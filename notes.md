### NOTES
## HTML
The html files include the basic default headings and sections like <!DOCTYPE hyml>, which let the broswser know that this is an html file; <html lang="en">, which sets the language to English; and metadata like <meta charset="UTF-8" /> and <    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />, which help specify the encoding of the HTML file and makes the webpage viewable on various aspect ratios and sizes.

 <title>Login</title> is seen at the top of the body section. It is very visible and clarifies the type of page currently being displayed.

 <form> <labevl> some lable </labevl> <input> some input <input> </form> is helpful when trying to get user input. the label tells the user what to input, while the input tells the page what to look for.

 I've also included the Git repository on every page, since I wasn't sure if it's only needed on the first page, despite my first page being a simple login page.
